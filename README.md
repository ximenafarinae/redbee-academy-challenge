# Challenge Redbee Academy

### About this
This repository aims to identify how much you know about programming.

There's not wrong answers, we only need that you feels comfortable with you are doing.

There are four challenges: 

* SumTwoNumbers: That receives two numbers and returns the sum of both
* SumArrayNumbers: That receives a list and return the sum of entire list 
* CompareNumbers: That receives three numbers and return the max of them
* CompareArrayNumbers: That receives two lists of numbers and returns a list with the max of both

For each challenge we created a set of tests to help you. Feel free to add more tests if you want.

Fork the repository and share the solution with:

* Caro (carolina.bergalli@redb.ee) 
* Mapsi (maxi.britez@redb.ee)
* Dal (dalma.diaz@redb.ee)
